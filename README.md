# Torque3D Awesomium Addon Pack
Welcome!

This pack lets you embed HTML5/Flash in your applications and games. You can integrate it via JavaScript to interact with elements in the game. [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frznHHWPAZE) to see a video of the pack in action.

* Powerful bridge between JavaScript and TorqueScript. This way you can communicate between HTML5/Flash and your game! Useful for interactive GUI screens ingame.
* Levarage existing tools like Adobe Dreamweaver to create content for your games.
* Shapes are load-balanced by distance and focus.
* Layer complex GUIs by using multiple transparent objects that can take focus from other such objects, or remain in place. All customizable.
* Caches textures from Awesomium for usage when the webpage is loading which makes for a smooth experience.
* Option to use static texture caches for any number of Awesomium Shapes, which is useful when you want lower-overhead Shapes with textures generated from HTML5/Flash.
